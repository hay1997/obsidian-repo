## Methodology 
**Methodology: 

-   Look at existing literature in [[Environmental Racism]] 
    
-   Discuss disparities in school lead monitoring methods 
    
-   Discrepancies in who was omitted from study. 
    
-   Treatment: [[Redlined neighborhoods/cities]]
    
-   Control: cities/neighborhoods that did not experience redlining 
    
-   Need to define place more: what scale are we looking at? Statewide. Looking at different neighborhoods within cities? 
    
-   Focus: Elementary schools discuss how lead can be more damaging during [[childrenâ€™s developmental years]].**
